  <abstract>
   <para>
    <application>ROX-Filer</application> is a graphical file manger for the X
    Window System. Its user interface is based on the RISC OS filer and it
    supports similar features such as application directories and drag-and-drop
    loading and saving of files. The filer can also act as a pinboard, allowing
    you to pin frequently used files onto the desktop background.

 <chapter id="compiling">
  <title>Compiling</title>
  <para>

   If you've just got hold of the filer by downloading the source archive
   then you'll need to compile it before you can use it. If you downloaded
   and installed a binary package, or if <application>ROX-Filer</application>
   was included with your system, then you can skip this section. If you got
   here by clicking on the `i' symbol in a filer window, or if typing
   <command>rox</command> at a shell prompt works, then you don't need to
   compile.

   <itemizedlist><title>To compile, you will need the following:</title>

    <listitem><para>
      Unix or Linux (root access is not required),
    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>
      The X Window system (supplied as standard on all modern systems),
    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>
      GTK+ 1.2.0 or later (libraries and headers) &mdash; get the latest version
      from <citation>GTK+</citation>,
    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>
      A C compiler, such as `gcc' (standard on most systems).
    </para></listitem>

   </itemizedlist>

   All of the above are standard on most modern Linux distributions.
   To check which version of GTK+ you have installed, run the
   <command>gtk-config</command> command, like this
   (<prompt>$</prompt> is the shell prompt):

   <screen>$ gtk-config --version
    1.2.8</screen>
   Due to bugs in earlier versions, GTK+ 1.2.8 is strongly
   recommended.
  </para>

  <procedure><title>To compile:</title>

   <step><para>
     The filer needs some shared files to work &mdash; icons for the various
     file types, rules for determining file types and default run actions.
     These are installed by the `rox-base' package. Install rox-base (from
     <ulink url="http://rox.sourceforge.net"/> now if you haven't done so already.
   </para></step>

   <step><para>
     Change to the directory containing the ROX-Filer subdirectory.
   </para></step>

   <step><para>
     Run the <command>install.sh</command> script, like this:

     <screen>$ ./install.sh</screen>

   </para></step>

   <step><para>
     <application>ROX-Filer</application> will perform various checks to find
     out what kind of system it is being run on and will then compile. If it
     doesn't work then please e-mail me and complain! Tell me what kind of
     system you have and what errors were reported. If you manage to fix the
     problem yourself then please e-mail me the fix.

     The executable file is stored inside the ROX-Filer directory in a
     different subdirectory for each platform. Therefore, you can compile
     the same application on several different types of machine and then
     run it from any of them using the AppRun script. This is particularly
     useful in a network environment.
   </para></step>

   <step><para>
     Once the filer has compiled you will be asked where you want to install
     it. If you want to do a system-wide installation as root, you may
     want to stop here, <command>su</command> to root and rerun the install script.

     If you don't have the root password then don't worry &mdash; just follow
     the instructions for installing into your home directory.
   </para></step>
  </procedure>

  <para>

   You can now run the filer by running the <command>rox</command> script without
   any options, like this:

   <screen>$ rox</screen>

   A window should appear and display the contents of the current directory.

   If you installed the script into your home directory then you may
   need to set your <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable so that the shell can
   find it. For example, if you installed it into a directory called
   <filename>bin</filename> in your home directory, use this:

   <screen>$ PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH; export PATH</screen>

   or (if you are using the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>csh</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> shell):

   <screen>$ setenv PATH $HOME/bin:$PATH
    $ rehash</screen>

  </para>

 </chapter>

 <chapter id="invoking">
  <title>Invoking</title>
  <para>

   By default, <application>ROX-Filer</application> will start by displaying
   the current directory.  You can get it to display other directories instead
   by listing them after the command:

   <screen>$ rox /home /usr /usr/local</screen>

   You can also use it to open files, like this:

   <screen>$ rox README</screen>

   The filer supports various options; use <option>-h</option> for a list.
   All options have long and short forms (eg <option>-h</option> and
   <option>--help</option>) &mdash; although on some systems you can only use the
   short versions.
   </para><para>
   Note that if the same version of the filer is already running on this
   machine then, by default, it will be used to open the directories.
   You can override this (perhaps because the old copy has stopped responding for
   some reason) using the <option>--new</option> option.
   </para><para>
   For a complete list of command-line options, see <xref linkend="manpage"/>
  </para>

  <sect1>
   <title><anchor id="run_pin" xreflabel="Pinboard support"/>Pinboard support</title>
   <para>

    If you want the filer to manage your desktop background then you use
    the <option>--pinboard</option> option and supply a name for the pinboard,
    eg:

    <screen>$ rox --pinboard=MyPinboard</screen>

    The pinboard configuration is saved in
    <filename>&lt;Choices&gt;/ROX-Filer/pb_MyPinboard</filename>
    as soon as you change it in some way (for example, by dropping a file
    onto the background). You can have as many pinboards as you like and
    switch between them by running rox again, eg:

    <screen>$ rox --pinboard=MyOtherPinboard</screen>

    To turn off the pinboard again, set the name to an empty string:

    <screen>$ rox --pinboard=</screen>

    See the <xref linkend="winman"/> if you have trouble getting the icons to
    display correctly. The pinboard may also be turned on and off by locating
    <filename>ROX-Filer</filename> in a filer window and choosing `Enable
    pinboard' or `Disable pinboard' from the menu.  </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title><anchor id="run_pan" xreflabel="Panel support"/>Panels</title>
   <para>

    Panels work just like the pinboard. You can create a panel on any
    side of the screen by using the options <option>--left</option>, <option>--right,</option>
    <option>--top</option> and <option>--bottom</option>, depending on which side
    of the screen the panel should appear on. On some systems, the short
    (one letter) form of the options must be used. For example, to create
    a panel along the bottom edge of the screen:

    <screen>$ rox -b=MyPanel</screen>

    The panel should be displayed in a window without a title bar. If
    this does not work then see the <xref linkend="winman"/> for some ideas.
    You can drag files onto either side of the panel to add them. Panel icons
    can be repositioned by dragging them with the middle mouse button.
    Changes to the panel are automatically saved to
    <filename>&lt;Choices&gt;/ROX-Filer/pan_MyPanel</filename>.
    As with the pinboard, you can switch between panel configurations
    simply by running rox again with a different panel name. Specify a
    blank name to remove the panel.

    <screen>$ rox --bottom=MyOtherPanel
     $ rox --bottom=</screen>

   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title id="winman" xreflabel="window manager notes">Window manager notes</title>
   <para>

    You may have to play around with your window manager a bit to get
    the pinboard icons and panels to display correctly (eg, without borders
    and underneath all other windows). In particular, try setting the
    stacking level / depth to low (or a negative value). Make sure any
    'Keep transients above other windows' type options are turned off!

    In order for the filer to receive mouse clicks on the background (used
    for the pinboard support) you need a GNOME-compliant window manager.
    To see if your window manager supports this, try clicking the right
    mouse button on an unused area of the background. If you get the pinboard
    menu, all is well.
   </para>

   <sect2><title>Sawfish / sawmill</title>
    <para>
     Sawfish tries to guess whether you are using GNOME at start-up and only
     provides support if so. You may need to add the line
     <programlisting>(require 'gnome)</programlisting>
     to your <filename>.sawfishrc</filename> file (see the sawfish manual
     for more details).
    </para>

   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Running as root</title>
   <para>

    If you run the filer as the `root' user then the filer will display
    a message at the top of each window to remind you. The root user has
    permission to access or change any file in the system, so be very
    careful when using the filer like this.

    Normally, you should log in as an ordinary user and only change to
    root when you need to. You can create a simple script which runs the
    filer as root &mdash; something like this:

    <programlisting>
     #!/bin/sh

     su -m -c "rox $*"</programlisting>

    Then, you can get a root filer window by simply running the script
    and entering the root password. Remember, any file operations you
    perform and any programs you run from these windows will run as root
    too! Be careful!

    You may find that the X server won't allow root (or other users) to
    connect. Reading the manual pages for <command>xauth</command> and
    <command>xhost</command> may give you some hints, but it varies
    between systems (which is why this isn't built in to the filer!).

   If you select something else (eg, some text in another program), the selected
   items in the filer window will be shown shaded (the filer no longer has the
   primary selection).  Clicking on one of the shaded items will cause the
   filer to regain the primary selection.

  <sect1><title>Saving and restoring the selection</title>
   <para>
    It is sometimes useful to save the current selection for later. You can
    save the current selection to one of ten numbered groups by pressing
    <keycap>Control</keycap>+<keycap>&lt;number&gt;</keycap>.
    You can restore a saved group by pressing the group number on its own. You
    can do this from a different directory, or even a different filer window.
    </para><para>
    Saving is also useful even if there is no selection, since it still saves
    the current directory.
   </para>

   By default, each window has a toolbar along the top. You can disable
   this (or make it larger) from the Options window, as well as set which
   tools appear on the toolbar. Normally, you should click with the left

   Dragging files to the Up or Home icons acts just like dragging them

     Permissions
    </title>
    <para>

     The permissions field, when shown, is made up of four groups of three
     flags. Each flag is displayed as a letter if it is on and a dash (&ndash;)
     if not. The first three characters show the permissions for the owner
     of the file, the second for other members of the file's group and
     the third for everyone else. Whichever group applies to the
     <application>ROX-Filer</application> process itself is shown underlined.
     The fourth group shows any special flags.
     </para><para>
     The meanings of the characters are:

     <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>r</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Permission to read the contents of a file, or the names of files
        in a directory.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>w</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Permission to alter the contents of a file, or change which names
        appear in a directory.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>x</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Permission to run the file as a program, or refer to the files
        listed within the directory.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>U</computeroutput> &mdash;
        This program executes with the <emphasis>effective user ID</emphasis> of its
        owner rather than the person who ran it.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>G</computeroutput> &mdash;
        This program executes with the <emphasis>effective group ID</emphasis> of its
        group, regardless of who ran it.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><computeroutput>T</computeroutput> &mdash;
        Entries in this directory can only be altered or removed by the
        people who own the files even if they have write permission on the
        directory itself.</para></listitem>

     </itemizedlist>
     For example,
     <programlisting>
      <emphasis role="underline">rwx</emphasis>,rwx,r-x/---</programlisting>
     means that the owner of the file is the same as the effective user of
     <application>ROX-Filer</application> (basically, you own the file), you and
     members of the file's group have read, write and execute permission and other
     people have only read and execute permission. There are no special flags set.

     The rules which determine which permissions apply may vary slightly between
     operating systems, but a rough guide is:

     <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>If the <emphasis>effective user ID</emphasis> of the
        process is equal to the file's owner, then the owner permissions apply.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Otherwise, if the <emphasis>effective group ID</emphasis>
        of the process is equal to the file's group OR the file's group is one
        of the process's <emphasis>supplemental groups</emphasis> then the
        group permissions apply.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Otherwise, the `other' permissions apply. The
        <emphasis>real user ID</emphasis> and <emphasis>real group
         ID</emphasis> have no effect (except that a process may set its real
        IDs to its effective IDs).
      </para></listitem>

     </itemizedlist>

    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>The file menu</title>
   <para>
    All of these work in the same way &mdash; if you open the menu with some
    items selected then the operation applies to those items. If you open
    then menu over an item while there is no selection then that item
    is temporarily selected.
    </para><para>
    If you choose one of these while there is no selection at all then the
    window goes into `target mode'; the operation happens to the next item you
    click on. Click on the window background, press <keycap>Escape</keycap>, or
    click with the right mouse button to cancel target mode. Target mode is
    mainly useful with the <guilabel>Single-click navigation in filer
    windows</guilabel> option and keys bound to the various menu entries.
    </para><para>

   <formalpara><title>Note about symlinks:</title>
    <para>
     A symbolic link stores the <emphasis>location</emphasis>
     of another file. Deleting the symlink doesn't affect the other file.
     Deleting the other file means that the symlink won't work. There are
     two types of symbolic link &mdash; Relative and Absolute. An absolute
     link stores the path from the root directory to the target file (eg
     <filename>/home/fred/MyFile</filename>).

     A relative path stores the path from the symlink
     to the target (eg <filename>../fred/MyFile</filename>).
     If the target file is never going to move then you want an absolute link,
     but if the target may move (and the symlink will be moved with it) then
     you want a relative link.

   <title>The new menu</title>
   <para>

    Each entry in this submenu opens a savebox for creating a new file or
    directory. There are two standard entries; the others are the contents of
    your <filename>&lt;Choices&gt;/Templates</filename> directory, if it
    exists.

         Copy a file from your Templates directory.
       </entry></row>
    </tbody></tgroup></informaltable>


    To add your own entries, create a new directory called
    <filename>~/Choices/Templates</filename>
    (if you have the default CHOICESPATH) and put any files you want in
    there. Each file in the directory will appear on the menu and the
    box that appears will copy it. For example, you could create a blank
    HTML file:

    <programlisting>
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My Page&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  The contents.
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

    Save this as <filename>index.html</filename> inside the
    <filename>Templates</filename> directory and you can easily create new
    HTML files. You can also save blank documents from various applications
    into here (eg, a blank spreadsheet, a blank letter, etc).

   <para>

    The `Send To' menu provides a quick way to send some files to an application.
    The filer scans all the <filename>SendTo</filename> directories in your
    <envar>CHOICESPATH</envar> and lists the contents on this menu.
    </para><para>
    To change which applications appear here you should choose the
    <guimenuitem>Customise</guimenuitem> item from the bottom
    of the menu to create and open your own SendTo directory. Applications can be
    symlinked into this directory by dragging them in with <keycap>Control</keycap>
    and <keycap>Shift</keycap> held down.
    </para><para>
    Opening the Send To menu via the main menu is rather slow, so it is
    normally opened by clicking the Menu mouse button over a file while
    holding the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key down.

   The <xref linkend="run_pin"/> and <xref linkend="run_pan"/> sections explain
   how to turn the pinboard and panels on. Once on, you may drop items from filer
   windows onto the them to pin them up. Clicking on a pinned item acts just like
   clicking on it in a filer window. You can drag pinned icons just like normal
   icons and you can right-click on one to see the popup menu.
   </para><para>
   Drag panel icons with the middle mouse button to move them around.
   In previous versions of the filer, pinboard icons were also moved using the
   middle mouse button. This may still work (depending on your window manager),
   but using the left mouse button is now preferred.
   </para><para>
   Changes to the pinboard and panel are automatically saved. Clicking on pinned
   icons with <keycap>Control</keycap> held down selects and unselects them.
   Click on the background to unselect them all.

   If the panel has so many icons that they can't all be shown at once

    Pinning a file does <emphasis>not</emphasis> copy it, it merely

  </title>
  <para>

   Some types of file can be represented as a directory. A typical example
   is a zip file, which contains an entire directory structure in compressed
   form. It is often useful to be able to open up such a file as if it
   was a real directory, and the VFS system allows you to do this.

   <itemizedlist><title>To use this feature you must have one or both of the
     following:</title>

    <listitem><para>
      A system such as AVFS<citation>AVFS</citation> which causes the kernel to
      support various Virtual File Systems directly. This is the best option
      since all programs will be able to access the contents of the VFS. You
      may require root access to install such a system, however, and it is not
      available on all platforms.
    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>
      Support for the Midnight Commander VFS library compiled into
      <application>ROX-Filer</application>. This happens automatically when you
      compile <application>ROX-Filer</application> if it can find
      the VFS library &mdash; this means having <filename>libvfs.so</filename>
      (or <filename>libvfs.a</filename>) in a system library directory or in the
      directory in the environment variable <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>. In
      this case, you will be able to view the directory structure and copy
      files out of it, but not change it.
     </para>

     <para>
      When using libvfs, the menu structure is slightly different &mdash;
      <guimenuitem>Open AVFS</guimenuitem> is replaced by the <guisubmenu>Open
       VFS</guisubmenu> submenu.  This is simply a short-cut for using the
      path-entry box (explained below), so if you want to use a VFS not listed
      on the menu you can type in the path directly, eg:
      <filename>/home/fred/archive.zip#uzip/</filename>.

      Don't forget the final slash!
      </para><para>
      Use of libvfs is strongly discouraged; use AVFS instead. Recent versions
      of the library don't compile properly, and it can't be used on many
      systems because it conflicts with large file support.

    This allows you to type in a path directly. As you type the display
    is updated to show the item entered visually. The main use is to find
    a file in a large directory quickly, but you can also use it for navigating
    between directories, or for selecting a full pathname from somewhere
    else and pasting it directly into the path-entry box.

    Tab completion tries to fill in as many characters for you as it can.
    For example, if there are two files in a directory called `save-mail-nov-1999'
    and `save-mail-dec-1999' then typing 'save' and pressing
    <keycap>Tab</keycap> will expand `save' to `save-mail-' and beep to
    indicate that the match is not complete. If you use tab completion on a
    directory and it is unique then the filer will automatically change into
    the directory. This behavior should be familiar to shell users.

   <title>Logic operators</title>
   <para>
    You can combine the above tests in various ways to perform more advanced
    searches.
    An expression is actually made up of a list of <emphasis>cases</emphasis>,
    separated by commas. The filer will try to match each case in turn
    until one matches or there are no more cases left. For example, to
    search for files with several possible endings:

    <screen>'*.gif', '*.htm', '*.html'</screen>

    Further, each of the cases is actually a list of conditions. The case
    only matches if all of its conditions are met. So, to find a directory
    called <filename>lib</filename> or a regular file ending in
    <filename>.so</filename>:

    <screen>IsDir 'lib', IsReg '*.so'</screen>

    You can negate a condition by putting a <userinput>!</userinput> in front
    of it and you can use a sub-expression as a condition by bracketing it,
    like this:

    <screen>
     !(IsDir, IsReg)

     !IsDir !IsReg

     Not isdir and not isreg

     !-d !-f</screen>
    All four do the same thing.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Comparisons</title>
   <para>
    You can also compare various values using the operators
    <userinput>&lt;</userinput>,
    <userinput>&lt;=</userinput>,
    <userinput>=</userinput>,
    <userinput>!=</userinput>,
    <userinput>&gt;</userinput>, and
    <userinput>&gt;=</userinput>
    (for less-than, less-than-or-equal-to, equal-to,
    not-equal-to, greater-than and greater-than-or-equal-to).

    When comparing times, you may find it helpful to use
    <userinput>after</userinput> and <userinput>before</userinput> instead of
    <userinput>&gt;</userinput> and <userinput>&lt;</userinput> to make things
    clearer.

    Times are measured as seconds since the Unix Epoch (00:00:00 UTC,
    January 1, 1970). Sizes are in bytes. When specifying constants to
    compare these values with you may use various keywords to scale the
    value:

     </para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    Some examples should make this all a bit clearer!

    <screen>
     mtime after 1 day ago

     size &gt; 10 Mb

     IsReg and nlinks &gt; 1</screen>
    The first finds files modified within the last 24 hours. You could
    use <userinput>&gt;</userinput> instead of <userinput>after</userinput>,
    but it's not so clear what is meant.
    </para><para>
    The second finds files larger than 10 Mb. The last finds regular files with
    more than one directory entry.
    </para><para>
    Be careful though &mdash; the filer doesn't check the context of the
    modifiers, so <userinput>size &gt; 1 day ago</userinput> is allowed,
    although it doesn't make much sense!

    Also, forgetting to use <userinput>ago</userinput> or
    <userinput>hence</userinput> will cause odd effects (the time will be
    measured relative to the Epoch rather than the current time).
    Finally, don't use <userinput>=</userinput> with times &mdash;
    <userinput>atime = 1 day ago</userinput> looks for a file accessed
    <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> 86400 seconds ago...

       <userinput>System(Command)</userinput> executes `Command' on the file.
       The test succeeds if the command returns an exit status of zero. A `%'
       character in `Command' is replaced by the full path of the file being
       checked.  <userinput>System</userinput> is a very slow test to perform,
       so do it last if possible.  For example, if you're looking for a
       <filename>.c</filename> file containing the word `main', do:

       <screen>'*.c' system(grep -q main "%")</screen>
       so that the grep is only performed for files ending in <filename>.c</filename>
       (as opposed to only checking that the file ends in <filename>.c</filename> if
       it contains the word `main').
     </para></listitem>

       However, if it gets evaluated at all then it prevents the filer
       from checking inside the current directory. Remember the order in which
       the filer checks the expression!
     </para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    Examples:

    <screen>
     '*.old' system(rm '%')

     'src' prune, '*.c'</screen>
    The first deletes each file ending in <filename>.old</filename>.
    The second looks for <filename>.c</filename> files, but does not bother
    checking inside directories called <filename>src</filename>.
    The expression is evaluated like this:
    </para><para>
    If file is named <filename>src</filename> then `Prune'.
    Either way, check if it ends in <filename>.c</filename> and include
    it in the results if so.

   All files have a MIME type in the form <emphasis>text/plain</emphasis>. Here,
   <emphasis>text</emphasis> is the <emphasis>media type</emphasis> and
   <emphasis>plain</emphasis> is the <emphasis>sub-type</emphasis>.
   </para><para>
   <application>ROX-Filer</application> uses a file's name to decide what its MIME
   type is, and then uses the MIME type to decide what icon to give it and what
   program to use when you open the file.

   <title><anchor id="RunAction" xreflabel="the Set Run Action box"/>
    The run action box
   </title>
   <para>

    This box appears when you choose <guimenuitem>Set Run Action...</guimenuitem>
    from the File menu, and is used to set which application is loaded when you click
    on a file.
    </para><para>
    For example, let's say you want to set things up so that opening a
    <filename>.gif</filename> file loads it into the Gimp.
    First, right-click over a gif image to open the menu and choose
    <guimenuitem>Set Run Action...</guimenuitem> from the
    <guimenuitem>File</guimenuitem> submenu.
    Then, you have a choice of two methods to set the run action:
   </para>

   <sect2><title>Setting the run action by drag-and-drop</title>
    <para>
     Drag the Gimp (from a filer window, a panel or the pinboard) onto
     the area marked <guilabel>Drop a suitable application here</guilabel>.
     From now on, clicking on a GIF file will load it into the Gimp.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2><title>Setting the run action by entering a shell command</title>
    <para>
     Type: <userinput>gimp "$1"</userinput>
     into the box labelled <guilabel>Enter a shell command</guilabel> and press
     <keycap>Return</keycap>. <userinput>$1</userinput>
     will be replaced by the name of the file you click on when this command
     is used. As before, clicking on any GIF image will now load it into
     the Gimp.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2><title>Setting the default media-type handlers</title>
    <para>
     Whichever method you use to set the action you have the choice of
     setting the run action just for that type, or setting the default
     for all files with that media-type which don't already have a specific
     action.
     </para><para>
     Since the Gimp can load many types of image, it makes sense
     to select the <guilabel>Set default for all `image/&lt;anything&gt;'</guilabel>
     option so you don't have to do it again for image/jpeg files and so on. However,
     this only affects types that don't already have a specific action
     (ie, those that would have brought up an error box if you tried to
     open them).

    The Set Icon box
   </title>
   <para>

    This box appears when you choose <guimenuitem>Set Icon...</guimenuitem>
    from the File menu, and is used to set which image to use to represent
    the file.
    </para><para>
    It works much like the Set Run Action box described above, except that
    you may specifiy an icon for one file individually (by name) as well as
    for all files of a particular type.
    </para><para>
    The directory icon inside the <guilabel>Drop an icon here</guilabel>
    area allows you to quickly get to a directory from which you are already
    using one or more icons.

  <sect1>
   <title>How filetypes are stored</title>
   <para>

    <application>ROX-Filer</application> uses three sub-directories in your Choices
    directory for filetypes:

    <variablelist>

     <varlistentry><term><filename>MIME-info</filename></term><listitem><para>
        contains files which specify what the MIME types for files
        should be, based on their extentions. All the files in all the
        <filename>MIME-info</filename> directories are scanned when the filer loads.
        <application>ROX-Filer</application> comes with a file containing many such
        rules &mdash; this is installed into the <filename>MIME-info</filename>
        directory by the rox-base package.
        </para><para>
        Many applications now come with a file called
        <filename>something.mime</filename>; copy these files into your
        <filename>MIME-info</filename> directory to make
        <application>ROX-Filer</application> automatically recognise the new extensions.
        ROX-Filer doesn't automatically re-read these files when they change. You can
        either restart the filer, or click on the <guibutton>Re-read files</guibutton>
        button in the <guilabel>Types</guilabel> section of the Options box.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><filename>MIME-types</filename></term><listitem><para>
        contains symlinks, one for each MIME type, which point
        to programs that can handle files of that type. To set what program
        is run when you click on the file you should normally use the <guimenuitem>Set
         Run Action...</guimenuitem> feature (see the <xref linkend="RunAction"/> section).
        However, you can also set the actions manually &mdash; for example, to make
        opening an HTML file load it into Netscape:

        <orderedlist>
         <listitem><para>
           Find the Netscape application and go to <guimenuitem>Link...</guimenuitem>
           on the menu.
         </para></listitem>

         <listitem><para>
           Enter <userinput>text_html</userinput> as the name for the link and drag the
           icon from the Link box into the <filename>MIME-types</filename> directory.
         </para></listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        You can also put actual programs in here as well as links if you want
        to.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><filename>MIME-icons</filename></term><listitem><para>
        contains the images used to display each type of file.
        So the filer will try to display an HTML file using the icon
        <filename>MIME-icons/text_html.xpm</filename>.
     </para></listitem></varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    In both <filename>MIME-types</filename> and <filename>MIME-icons</filename>
    directories you can also provide default actions/images for each media type.
    For example, if <filename>text_html</filename> isn't found then the filer
    will try simply using <filename>text</filename>.

   Application directories
  </title>
  <para>
   An application directory is a directory which can be run as an application.
   It contains all the resources of an application &mdash; source code, binaries,
   documentation and so on. Keeping everything in one place make installation
   and uninstallation much easier for users. You can also keep multiple
   versions of a program by simply having several application directories.
   You may move and rename them as you please. Application directories
   make programs easier to use and install.
   </para><para>
   They're more secure too, because you can compile an application as a user and
   then simply copy it as root. Since you don't have to run an install script
   you are free from the danger of running untrusted code as root. All you have
   to watch out for is setuid binaries.

   <para>
    When people make small modifications to the sources they will often

    mailing list.

    To apply a patch, go into the <filename>src</filename> directory and run

    <screen>
     $ cd ROX-Filer/src

    To create a patch you should first get the latest version of the filer

    Modify the program as you please. Create the patch using
    <command>cvs diff</command> from the appropriate directory:

    <screen>$ cvs diff -u &gt; my_patch</screen>

 <appendix id="soap"><title>SOAP RPC</title>

  <para>When the filer starts you can use command-line options to control its behaviour.
   As an alternative to this, the filer allows you to specify an operation with a
   <citation>SOAP</citation> RPC format message. In fact, if you use the command-line options,
   the filer converts to SOAP RPC internally.
  </para>

  <para>All SOAP RPC messages are passed on standard input, like this:

   <screen>
    $ rox --RPC &lt;&lt; EOF
    &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
    &lt;env:Envelope xmlns:env="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"&gt;
    &lt;env:Body xmlns="http://rox.sourceforge.net/SOAP/ROX-Filer"&gt;
    &lt;Panel&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;Default&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;Side&gt;Bottom&lt;/Side&gt;
    &lt;/Panel&gt;
    &lt;/env:Body&gt;
    &lt;/env:Envelope&gt;
    EOF</screen>

   The following methods are recognised:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

   <listitem><para><function>Version</function>()
     Returns the filer's version.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>CloseDir</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     Close directory <parameter>Filename</parameter> and all its subdirectories.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Examine</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     <parameter>Filename</parameter> may have changed &mdash; check it and
     update the display.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>OpenDir</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     Open a window showing directory <parameter>Filename</parameter>.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Panel</function>(<parameter>Side</parameter>,
     [<parameter>Name</parameter>])
     Open the panel named <parameter>Name</parameter> on screen side
     <parameter>Side</parameter> (<userinput>Top</userinput>|<userinput>Bottom</userinput>|<userinput>Left</userinput>|<userinput>Right</userinput>).
     <parameter>Name</parameter> can be a name in Choices (eg,
     <userinput>MyPanel</userinput>) or a full pathname.
     If not given, the panel on that side is turned off.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Pinboard</function>([<parameter>Name</parameter>])
     Display pinboard <parameter>Name</parameter> on the desktop background.
     <parameter>Name</parameter> can be a name in Choices (eg,
     <userinput>MyPinboard</userinput>) or a full pathname.
     If not given, the pinboard is turned off.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Run</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     Run <parameter>Filename</parameter> as if it was clicked on in the filer.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Show</function>(<parameter>Directory</parameter>,
     <parameter>Leafname</parameter>)
     Open <parameter>Directory</parameter> and flash the file
     <parameter>Leafname</parameter> inside it.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>FileType</function>(<parameter>Filename</parameter>)
     Returns the MIME-type of <parameter>Filename</parameter> (by writing the
     SOAP response to standard output).
   </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   The following calls can be used to start new file actions.
   <parameter>Quiet</parameter> can be <userinput>true</userinput> if the
   operation should start immediately, instead of waiting for the user to
   confirm. If <userinput>false</userinput>, the user must always confirm. If
   not given, the default setting is used.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><function>Copy</function>(<parameter>From</parameter>,
     <parameter>To</parameter>, [<parameter>Leafname</parameter>,
     <parameter>Quiet</parameter>])
     Copy each file in the array <parameter>From</parameter> to the directory
     <parameter>To</parameter>. If <parameter>Leafname</parameter> is given
     then <parameter>From</parameter> should contain a single entry only;
     <parameter>Leafname </parameter> gives the new leafname.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Move</function>(<parameter>From</parameter>,
     <parameter>To</parameter>, [<parameter>Leafname</parameter>,
     <parameter>Quiet</parameter>])
     Move each file in the array <parameter>From</parameter> to the directory
     <parameter>To</parameter>. If <parameter>Leafname</parameter> is given
     then <parameter>From</parameter> should contain a single entry only;
     <parameter>Leafname</parameter> gives the new leafname.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Link</function>(<parameter>From</parameter>,
     <parameter>To</parameter>, [<parameter>Leafname</parameter>])
     Symlink each file in the array <parameter>From</parameter> to the
     directory <parameter>To</parameter>. If <parameter>Leafname</parameter> is
     given then <parameter>From</parameter> should contain a single entry only;
     <parameter>Leafname</parameter> gives the new leafname.
   </para></listitem>

   <listitem><para><function>Mount</function>(<parameter>MountPoints</parameter>,
     [<parameter>OpenDir</parameter>, <parameter>Quiet</parameter>])
     Mount each directory in the list <parameter>MountPoints</parameter>. If
     <userinput>true</userinput>, <parameter>OpenDir</parameter> causes each
     directory to be opened once it is mounted.
   </para></listitem>
