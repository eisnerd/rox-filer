/* A word about interfaces:
 *
 * gobject's documentation's explanation of interfaces leaves something[1] to
 * be desired, so I'd better explain here...
 *
 * [1] Like, eg, an explanation.
 *
 * A ViewIfaceClass is a struct which contains a number of function
 * pointers. Each class that implements the View interface creates its
 * own ViewIfaceClass with pointers to its implementation. This is stored
 * with the class.
 * 
 * When you want to call a method (eg, sort()) on a View, you call
 * view_sort(object) here, which gets the class of object and then looks
 * for that class's implementation of the View interface, and then calls
 * the actual function through that.
