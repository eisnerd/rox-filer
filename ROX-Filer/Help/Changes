Fixed libxml compile problem (reported by Keith Hopper).

02-Jul-2002 (Release 1.2.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Backported fixes from 1.3.x series:

- Set Run Action to a shell command would make the executable world-writeable
  (spotted by alexander).

  Toloza).
- Fixed compile problem with libxml's parser.h.
- More robust approach to SOAP errors.

  ROX-Filer 1.3.x instead).
- When copying directories, ignore an error caused by filesystems,
  such as Samba shares, that don't support chmod fully (reported by
  Andrew S Dixon).
- Using another window in between entering target mode and selecting
  the target printed a warning instead of performing the operation.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated Hungarian translation (Andras Mohari).

Updated French translation (Vincent Lefèvre).
Updated Dutch translation (Wilbert Berendsen).

22-Jan-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
_ROX_PANEL_MENU_POS property is now set on each GtkSocket window, rather than

~~~~~~~~~~~
Use 'ISO8859-1' instead of 'iso-8859-1' and fallback to strdup if charset
conversion fails (Stephen Watson).

Deleting a symlink to a pinboard or panel icon showed a warning, even though
there was no danger, because it followed the symlink. Trying to copy a symlink
inside the directory it pointed to failed for the same reason.

17-Jan-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Big changes to internationalisation for pinboards and panels to fix problems
with incompatible character sets (reported by Arnaud Calvo).
When creating thumbnails, create to a temporary file and rename in case another
program tries to write the save thumbnail at the same time.

installing without an X server (requested by Michael Duelli).

16-Jan-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Converter for old-format config files now stops if the file looks like
XML (probably from a failed conversion).
Allow '~' in globicons file.

23-Dec-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Version SOAP RPC.
With Gtk+-2.0 UTF-8 converstion, the filer now converts from the charset
specified in the translation (was always using iso-8859-1).

22-Dec-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
If thumbnailing is cancelled, it can be resumed later. Hiding thumbnails
stops any scan in progress automatically. Added 'All' and 'Thumbs' status
flags to title bar.

21-Dec-2001

New 'Show image thumnails' option to set this as the default (requested by
Kristian Rink).

13-Dec-2001 (Release 1.1.9)
~~~~~~~~~~~
More fixes for panel resizing (reported by Stephen Watson).
Target mode, dragging an unselected item, and auto-selecting an item when
opening the menu now all work without grabbing the primary selection.

12-Dec-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking on an item which is selected, but not part of the primary selection,

~~~~~~~~~~~

code a bit.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed Gtk+-2.0 wheel mouse support.
In the Info box, 'File says...' was reporting on the program used to
edit the file, not the file itself!

correctly (Stephen Watson). Note: this disables libvfs support.
New option to have the minibuffer open by default on new windows
(Bochicchio).

05-Dec-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
When resizing the collection, only ensure the cursor is still visible if
it was in the displayed area before.

on a hidden item.

When using --show with a hidden file, turn on Show Hidden. Also, delay the
winking effect until the window actually appears.

~~~~~~~~~~~

29-Nov-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moved 'Select All', 'Clear Selection' and 'Select If...' to a new 'Select'

- Disk usage forgot to count special files like pipes, etc.
- Page up/down scrolls a window full at a time instead of 10 items.
- Don't get icons from the cache if thumbnail mode is off anymore.
- modechange.c: deleted useless stuff and fixed octal parsing to detect

Use --version instead of 'which' to test for programs as not everyone has
which (suggested by Vincent Lefevre).
Bugfix: When setting an icon for a file with a space in the name, the

	Turski). The 'globicons' file should be converted automatically
	when the filer is run.

08-Oct-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for the regex field in MIME-info. This allows files to be

~~~~~~~~~~~
Replaced 'New File...' menu item with a submenu generated from the contents
of '<Choices>/Templates' (Stephen Watson).

20-Jun-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
`Xterm here' command can contain arguments (Andras Mohari).
Made the menu appear in a sensible place, so it's easy to get to the File
submenu (suggested by André Wyrwa).

19-Jun-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated French translation (Vincent Lefèvre).
Added a German translation (André Wyrwa).

13-Jun-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added an extra option to control the resizing behaviour. Can be set to resize
never, always, or only when the display style changes (requested by Andreas).

07-Jun-2001 (Release 1.1.5)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated Russian translation (Dmitry Elfimov).

06-Jun-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Unless compiling with mc's libvfs for virtual filesystem support, change the
menu structure for use with the newer AVFS system.
(http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/avfs/) (José Romildo Malaquias).

Bug fix: Running the filer with a translation set would make it crash
	 (reported by Dmitry Elfimov).

04-Jun-2001 (Release 1.1.4)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added 'Details' toolbar icon. Toggles display between Small Icons with Summary
and the default size with no details.

30-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Replaced Large/Small toolbar buttons with a single Size button which
cycles through Small/Large/Huge (other button to reverse).

28-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Shift Open, Set Run Action and Set Icon to the pinboard and panel
menus.

25-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Long leafnames wrap onto multiple lines in Huge mode, like they do for
Large Icons mode.

24-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Display tooltips for pinboard and panel icons, where needed.

23-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
New option to show number of files / size of selected files in the toolbar
(Andras Mohari).

22-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
New options section 'panel' allows icon text to be hidden for all icons, no
icons, or just applications (suggested by José Romildo Malaquias).

17-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Converted the options window to a tabbed notebook (Denis Manente).

16-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing the mouse button down on an icon no longer winks it; only releasing
the button to run it does.
Added 'Show Info' to panel/pinboard menu.
The File Info box grabs the primary selection when a row is selected
(allows you to paste email addresses, URLs, etc).

15-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Opening a pinboard or panel menu over an icon no longer selects it -- this
allows the selection to be passed to an application run using its AppMenu
(requested by Christopher Arndt).

14-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
In Large Icons display style, a file's name may wrap onto a second line.

13-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Merged code for handling selections and menus that was common to pinboards
and panels into icon.c.

09-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
When using 'From LANG', extract the language code from the string to get
the filename, instead of using the whole string (Andras Mohari).
Added support for very old versions of libxml (reported by Lukasz Stelmach
and Vincent Lefèvre).

08-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated French (Vincent Lefevre) and Hungarian (Andras Mohari) translations.

07-May-2001 (Release 1.1.3)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated the documentation.

06-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added 'Huge, With...' display styles. In huge mode, normal icons are scaled
up if they're too small.

03-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Gtk styles can be overridden in <Choices>/ROX-Filer/Styles (suggested by
Stephen Watson).
Pinboards and panels should now work with IceWM without needing -o
(Christopher Arndt).
Allow text messages in the toolbar to go off the side (instead of resizing the
window).

02-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Opening the shell minibuffer with a selection adds ' "$@' after the cursor.
Without a selection, the name of the file under the cursor is added.

29-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing the `\' key opens the menu (suggested by Christopher Arndt). Hold
down Ctrl for the File submenu.

28-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a new 'About' section to AppInfo. Any elements in here are added
into the info box. Added a 'Refresh' button to the info box.
Added a ROX-Filer/Styles file for default colours (default filer background
is now lighter).

27-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Rewrote the file info box. Looks a bit nicer, and it's easier to add extra
info to it later...

26-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated Russian translation (Dmitry Elfimov).

25-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
AppInfo file may contain a <Summary> element - the text inside will be
displayed in a tooltip if the mouse is held over the item in a filer
window.

22-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Filer now looks for AppInfo.xml before AppMenu. This is for future
expansion...

18-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Automatic resizing of windows when changing directory is now optional
(requested by Paul E. Johnson and Andreas Thorn).

11-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
The symlink box allows you to choose to create relative or absolute links
(suggested by Stephen Watson).

09-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fix some typos and untranslated strings (Andras Mohari).

08-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a Russian translation (Dmitry Elfimov).

06-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a couple of errors in the man-page (spotted by Damien Couderc).

05-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Winking an item in a directory makes it flash twice instead of once (easier
to see). Also, creating a new file or directory from the menu winks the new
item.

Bugfix: When a directory was rescanned because of a move operation,
	the `Set Icon...' settings didn't work (reported by Damien
	Couderc).

02-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
New display style 'Huge Icons' to make viewing thumbnails easier.
Added a Hungarian translation (Andras Mohari).
Updated the French translation (Vincent Lefèvre).
Double clicking on a filer window's background resizes the window (Denis
Manente).

01-Apr-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
If an item's name is truncated, show it in a tooltip when the pointer is
held over the item (Denis Manente).

30-Mar-2001 (Release 1.1.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Asking for help on a directory always tries to open <dir>/Help first, even
for non-applications.

29-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
If run without -n, the filer will put itself in the background. Thus,
the 'rox' command behaves the same whether or not the filer is already
running.

27-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Support for the new version of libxml (reported by Andreas Dehmel).

26-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Rewrote parser for options. Smaller and neater (hopefully this will fix
the bugs reported by Andreas Dehmel and Ewan Mac Mahon).

Bugfix: While scanning, the resizer could make the window too large.

23-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moving the cursor down in the next-to-last row will move to the last
item if there is nothing under the cursor (suggested by Graham Borland).

21-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
When changing directory, only make the window larger (if needed), never
smaller (suggested by Diego Zamboni).

17-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changing directory autosizes the window automatically (Denis Manente).
Internal changes to the way different layouts are handled.

15-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing space (to select/unselect an item) now also moves the cursor to
the next item (suggested by Anders Lundmark).

Copying directories tries to preserve the timestamps, like it does for
files (suggested by José Romildo Malaquias).

14-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added '--mime-type FILE' option, which simply writes the type of FILE to
standard output (Stephen Watson).

Added 'Home Directory' to Window menu (requested by Graham Borland).

11-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Copying a directory which doesn't have user write permission will give it
user write during the copy to avoid permission denied errors (suggested by
Liav Asseraf).

New sort option - 'Directories always come first' (requested by Liav Asseraf).

10-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging a lasso box with the middle button toggles the selected state
of the items enclosed (Denis Manente).

09-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changing the display style now resizes the window (Denis Manente).

08-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
New pinboards get a 'Home' icon in the top left corner as new users often
think the pinboard isn't working because it starts empty (suggested by
Vor'Cha).

Converted AppMenu file format to XML.
Added AppMenu file with options to control the pinboard.

06-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Highlight invalid Find expressions in red (Anders Lundmark).

04-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
When resizing windows, try to keep the window fully inside the screen area
(Denis Manente).

03-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated the Dutch translation (Jan Wagemakers).

27-Feb-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
When mounting a device, the new window appears after mounting, not before.
This means that it's more likely to get sized correctly (requested by
Ewan Mac Mahon).

24-Feb-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added two new options to control when minibuffer completion beeps (requested
by Liav Asseraf).

20-Feb-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added 'New File...' feature (James Kermode).

16-Feb-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dropping icons on the pinboard positions them sensibly (Diego Zamboni).

09-Feb-2001 (Release 1.1.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moving pinboard icons is nicer - it no longer assumes you dragged the middle
of the text... (Diego Zamboni).

Added a Polish translation (Andrzej Borsuk).

Bugfix: Sometimes it wasn't possible to delete something that was on a
	pinboard or panel, even after confirming (reported by Diego Zamboni).

07-Feb-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Sliders in the options box can have a numerical value display (Diego Zamboni).
Fixed a stray warning message displayed when non-default pinboard options
were used (Diego Zamboni).

New menu item 'Set Icon...' allows you to choose any icon for any file or
directory. Also allow .DirIcon.png to set a directory's icon (Diego Zamboni).

03-Feb-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Many internal changes to the Options system.

30-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: On filesystems which aren't case sensitive (eg DOS) it was possible
	to copy 'tmp' as 'Tmp' and lose it! (reported by Denis Manente)

28-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Diego Zamboni's patch to make configuring VFS easier.

27-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved compiling - now correctly reports an error if the file doesn't
compile. If configure is missing then autoconf is run automatically.

After a Find completes, you are given the option of doing the search again
(Anders Lundmark).

Applications can define a list of menu items to display on their menus
(Diego Zamboni). The file should be called 'AppMenu' and contains a list of
lines in the form 'option Text'.

24-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added two new pinboard options - one to allow setting the grid step size
and one to allow icons to go slightly off the side of the screen (Diego
Zamboni).

23-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: Textured window backgrounds could cause a crash (reported by Diego
	Zamboni).

22-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated the French translation (Vincent Lefèvre).

Bugfix: The pixbuf stuff didn't work on some displays (reported by Stephen
	Watson).

20-Jan-2001 (Release 1.1.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed the 'Initial window height' option. The filer tries to pick a
sensible shape itself now.

Bugfix: If an image was moved to a directory which didn't generate thumbs
	then it would display, but never be updated. Even if it wasn't that
	file at all, just a reused inode!
Bugfix: Changing the display style didn't always redraw the display.
Bugfix: In 'Small, With...' display mode, clicking beyond the far right
	column acted like clicking on the far-right column.

18-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed background colour to be more compatible with the Gtk themes system.

12-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed all the message window stuff. ROX-Filer no longer grabs standard
error from its child processes. Changed because ROX-Session now does a much
better job.

10-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Filer is more generous in what hostnames it considers local.
Patch to include pixbuf headers correctly (Diego Zamboni).

08-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bug fix: Didn't always use the fully qualified host name for DnD.

30-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
If a file has a known extension then it is given the appropriate type even
if the file is executable (Simon Britnell).

28-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a menu entry 'Resize Window' to set the window to a sensible size
when you want it.

25-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Try to open new windows at a sensible size for their contents (Denis Manente).

24-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: When mounting or unmounting subdirectories of '/', the mount symbol
	wasn't updated (reported by Wilbert Berendsen).

20-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a couple of memory leaks in the choices system (Diego Zamboni).
Updated French translation (Vincent Lefèvre).
Added new 'Create Thumbs' entry on the Display menu which tries to load
every file in the directory as an image and use that image for the file
(suggested by Sprague and Simon Britnell).

19-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Converted to use gdk-pixbuf instead of ImLib.
Fixed a few compiler warnings and improved the error message displayed
if you try to invoke rox on a missing file (reported by Vincent Lefèvre).
Changed the -w, -W and -i flags to the simpler -x=FILE, which reexamines the
given file, updating directory views and icons as needed.

18-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
AppIcon.xpm must be a regular file (stops people trying to crash the
filer by symlinking to /dev/...).
Fixed a missing translation in the pinboard options (Denis Manente).

17-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Attempting to run the filer before compiling will now ask if you want
to compile.
Removed lots of platform-specific mount point code and replaced it with
python's portable system.
New options section allows you to choose a translation without having to
set the LANG variable.

16-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added '-w', '-i' and '-W' command line options for forcing icons or
directories to be rescanned (Diego Zamboni).

13-Dec-2000 (Release 1.0.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made a few updates to the manual.

08-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixes to make compiling easier on Solaris (Diego Zamboni). Also, after showing
a pinboard icon, tries to send it to the back (might help with some WMs).

04-Dec-2000 (Release 0.1.30)
~~~~~~~~~~~
When a panel is used for the first time, put the user's home directory and
the directory containing ROX-Filer on it instead of leaving it blank.

24-Nov-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Patch to make compiling easier under FreeBSD (Jimmy Olgeni).
Added a #include for OSF1 (Vincent Lefevre).

23-Nov-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: On many systems, the filer would fail to remove zombie processes
	due to a typo (spotted by Philip Hazel and tracked down by Stephen
	Watson).

22-Nov-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: Removing an item from the panel now resizes the panel (reported
	by Wilbert Berendsen).
Bugfix: Editing an icon's path failed to update its hash entry.

20-Nov-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
If a case-sensitve match for an extension can't be found then try a
case-insensitive match - so .BMP and similar work (Denis Manente).

17-Nov-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
A few changes to remove some compiler warnings (reported by Vincent Lefevre).
Added a VFS menu entry for .deb files (Vincent Ledda).

11-Nov-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Mounting or unmounting a directory forces mtab to be reread, even if the
timestamp hasn't changed (problem reported by Wilbert Berendsen).

When the 'Unique windows' option is on, remove the old window AFTER creating
the new one, so that the filer doesn't quit because there are zero windows
open... (Denis Manente).

07-Nov-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated the Dutch translation (Jan Wagemakers).

29-Oct-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated the French translation (Vincent Lefèvre).

Using --version and --help options no longer requires an X server connection,
the man-pages are more standard, and 'man ROX-Filer' is allowed as well as
'man rox' (Bernard Jungen). 

Bugfix: A corrupted AppIcon.xpm could crash the filer.

24-Oct-2000 (Release 0.1.29)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Code tidying: Replaced an XLib call with a gdk one (Denis Manente) and amended
	the makedist script to remove the .cvsignore files (spotted by Andy
	Piper).

20-Oct-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved the install script so that it installs the man-page. Also made it
easier to use. Updated the French translation and fixed a couple of
typos (Vincent Lefèvre).

17-Oct-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Gtk+ doesn't always scroll entry widgets to show the selection - apply a
workaround (Denis Manente) - this improves the Copy/Rename/etc boxes.

08-Oct-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a Dutch translation (Jan Wagemakers).

05-Oct-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added an Italian translation (Denis Manente).

04-Oct-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: If AppRun was a symlink, then the owner of the file was checked, not
	the owner of the symlink. Slight security risk, and also prevented
	users symlinking AppRun to their binaries...

29-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: Deleting a pinboard icon while it was highlighted caused a crash.
	This means it is now possible to click on a pinboard icon to change
	between pinboards...

Bugfix: Textured window backgrounds didn't redraw correctly when scrolled
	or resized. Now flickers when resizing if there's a textured
	background - seems to be necessary :-(

26-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Running as root now simply turns on the -u flag, rather than displaying
a warning box.

The toolbar height is now correctly taken into account when sizing a new filer
window (Denis Manente).

When guessing file types from extensions, the filer now tries to find the
longest extension that matches (eg .ps.gz, then .gz).

25-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
The lasso box is now drawn so that the box will be in the foreground colour
over the background, rather than by just inverting the pixel value and hoping
it's visible (spotted by Philip Hazel).

24-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
If the home directory is '/' then don't show it as '~' (suggested by
Bernard Jungen).

Added '--show=FILE' option - this will be needed by other ROX
applications, so it needs to be in version 1.0.0.

Bugfix: -d option didn't use realpath before sending to an already-running
filer.

22-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'install.sh' script now uses 'printf' instead of 'echo -e' to suppress
newlines (suggested by Bernard Jungen).

Bugfix: Close tool was always disabled on startup (reported by Martin Ward).

20-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a man-page (Andy Piper).
Changed `install.sh' from bash to sh (Bernard Jungen).

18-Sep-2000 (Release 0.1.28)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: menu entries on the pinboard menu weren't being shaded and
	unshaded correctly.

17-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed 'Rename Item' to 'Edit Icon' and allowed changing the path that
the icon points to as well as its name.

All i?86 platforms are treated as being equivalent (so, if you compile
on a 386 then it'll still run on a 486).

16-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinboard icons can also be renamed.
Pinboard and panel icons can have '~' or '~/' at the start of their
pathnames - this should make it easier to create a system-wide default
panel or pinboard with icons relative to the user's home directory.

14-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Panel icons can now be renamed (suggested by Ewan Mac Mahon).

13-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changing the toolbar options affects existing windows, not just new ones.
Removed the 'Size Bars' display style and replaced it with 'Permissions',
'Type' and 'Times' styles.

12-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
With items that spread over their normal width because they're on the
edge of the window, clicking on the extra bit now works.

Added a size limit of 400K on application icons. This is to prevent
someone trying to crash the filer by linking /tmp/MyApp/AppIcon.xpm
to some huge file!

Dragging an item with the middle button when none are selected unselects
the item after the drag.

Added 'Show Location' feature for pinboard and panels - opens a directory
showing where the file really is.

11-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Allowed items in the far right column to spread right to the edge of the
window. Fixed a bug which prevented Delete from working if there was
no pinboard.

10-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Deleting items first checks if it will affect the pinboard or panel. A
warning is displayed if so.

Upgraded the query dialog (from ROX-Session) - looks nicer.

09-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
'Unique filer windows' option now has no effect while the spring open
feature is active (spotted by Andrew Booker). Also, when opening a new
window, the old window is destroyed and a new one created (rather than
reusing the old one). This ensures that the new window appears in the
right place.

When a drag from the pinboard or a filer window ends, the selection is
only cleared if the icon was selected by starting the drag. Thus, it now
works like the panels.

08-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
New Close toolbar button (requested by Martin Ward).
Toolbar icons can be turned on and off from the Options box.
Removed the 'Mount' menu entry, since 'Shift Open' does it too.
Made the Shift Open menu text change depending on what is selected.
Bugfix: dragging icons around no longer saved the new pinboard state!

07-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Running a second copy of the filer as another user will start a new copy
instead of reusing the existing one. Added the '-u' option to display the
name of the user running the filer in each window (also suppresses the
normal don't-run-as-root warning).

Added '-d', which opens a directory as a directory, even if it looks like
an application.

Updated the manual.

Added Large and Small toolbar buttons. Right-clicking brings up a menu.

06-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moved 'Set Run Action' to the file menu (suggested by Ewan Mac Mahon), and
made using it bring up a dialog rather than a minibuffer. Hopefully it is now
easier to use!

Added much improved icons for executables and for applications without icons
of their own (Victor Liu See-le).

Allow '/' on the pinboard and panel (text wasn't displayed - spotted by
Tim Rowledge).

Bugfix: auto-scrolling didn't always stop when a drag ended.
Bugfix: creating a panel with the same name as a file in the current
	directory caused an error due to a throwback from when panels were
	directories (spotted by Ewan Mac Mahon).

30-Aug-2000 (Release 0.1.27)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Increased the distance you have to move the pointer to start a drag
slightly. Updated the manual.

Panel icons can now be moved from one side to the other by simply moving
over the gap in the middle. Previously, you had to jump over an icon on
the other side.

Left and right panels look better now. Also, they shrink if you add a top
or bottom panel to make room.

28-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging on the panel background allows you to slide the bar back and
forth.

27-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a slight bug with lasso boxes, which could cause them to be drawn in
the wrong place. Install script no longer overwrites the default run
actions; if the user has changed them leave them alone!
(Martin Ward noted that symlinking to an executable would cause the
executable to be destroyed on upgrade!)

24-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
More improvements to the event handling. Seems to be working again at
last!
Made the toolbar buttons slightly larger, and added a textual display
for 'Next Click' mode (eg 'Delete ... ?' when it's waiting for you to
click).
Moved the pinboard over to the new mouse binding code too.

21-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Started rewriting the event handling for filer windows to go through
the new code in bind.c, like the panel handling does.

20-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
You can now drag icons from the panel to other applications.

18-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging panel icons with the middle button allows you to move them around.

New option to set the default height for new filer windows (patch from
James Kermode).

17-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Selecting panel icons now grabs the primary selection. Pasting pastes all
selected file path names. Icons can now be added to either side of the panel.

Bug fix: Moving a file didn't always update the source directory.

16-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Many improvements to the panel - drag and drop to icons, adding new icons,
selections (doesn't grab the primary selection yet though), removing icons
and automatically saving the panel when it's changed.
	
11-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved reference counting on images (hopefully!). Lots of work on
rewriting the panel system.

07-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made the timeout for the spring-open feature configurable (requested by
Chris Garrett).

Use short form of --version in install.sh and don't use unsetenv() if it
isn't available (Mattias Engdegård).

06-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
New options to set the pinboard text foreground and background colours
(suggested by James Kermode).

05-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Your home directory is now displayed as '~' in the title bar, rather
than as a full path.

01-Aug-2000 (Release 0.1.26)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a popup menu of commonly used chmod strings to the Permissions
box. Bracketed text and spaces are now ignored in the commands.
Bug fix: Only menu keys changed since the last load were saved!

31-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bug fix: Mount points on the pinboard didn't always redraw when the
mounted/unmounted state changed.

30-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Renaming now uses the action windows. This means that you can now
rename something onto another filesystem.

28-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
The menu key bindings are now only saved if they actually changed.

Code tidying: Moved some typedefs to the new `global.h' file and
thus removed the dependencies between header files :-)

26-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tab and Shift-Tab move to next and previous selected item.

25-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
The new display styles can now be saved as the defaults (bug spotted by
Vladimir Klebanov).

When autoscrolling is used, prevent the last-highlighted directory
from springing open. 'spring open' now defaults to off.

The toolbar Up and Home buttons can act as drop targets (and spring open
too!).

Options to set the pinboard text background style (suggested by James
Kermode).

23-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added an option to control the spring-loading feature. Added tooltips
to some of the options. Improved the rule for deciding whether to open
a new window when you click on the toolbar buttons.

Stopped the spring-open window moving while it's open (prevents a bug
in GTK+ from causing problems). Please use GTK+ 1.2.8 or later now!

Dragging near the edge of a window scrolls. Improved the lasso box drag
to use the same system (so it scrolls without you having to move the
mouse).

22-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added 'spring-loaded' directories. If you drag a file over a directory and
hold it there, the directory will spring open! (suggested by Barney
Clarkson)

21-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
In the path entry minibuffer, an exact match is favoured over any other
match. So, if you enter '.xsession' and press Return you'll get it, not
'.xsession-errors' or whatever!

The filer now clears APP_DIR from the environment so that child processes
don't get it. Fixed a bug which caused problems when using a small version
of the 'missing image' image.

19-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a new directory now makes sure the display is updated.

18-Jul-2000 (Release 0.1.25)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Prevent dragging from a pinboard selection to itself, or onto the desktop
background.

17-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking on the root window works (button-1 clears the selection,
button-3 opens the pinboard menu). The pinboard can own the primary
selection, which means that you can select something and then paste
its name into another program.

Keys bound to menu entries are automatically saved when the filer quits.

16-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the install script so that the CVS directories don't get installed.

The 'rox' script now just calls AppRun directly.
Panels can be created without starting a new copy of the filer.
The pinboard can be changed or removed by using --pinboard a second time.

Files can be given as arguments - they are opened as if they were clicked
on in a filer window (suggested by Alex Holden).  If no arguments are
given then the default is now the current directory (not your home
directory).

If you start the leafname in the path minibuffer with '.' then the Show
Hidden feature is temporarily turned on.

15-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Ctrl-clicking selects and unselects pinboard icons. Menu clicking
selects the icon clicked on while the menu is open. Pinned icons are
now updated when the pointer moves over them, if necessary.

14-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Menu-clicking on a pinboard icon now brings up a menu.
Clicks on the root window are still ignored though; need to support
the GNOME-compliant window manager system for passing root clicks on...

12-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Files can now be dragged to pinboard icons, and they highlight nicely too!
If the --override option is used, the filer will bypass the window manager
and position the icons directly.

11-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinboard icons can now be dragged to filer windows or applications, just
like normal icons.

10-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the DnD code to make it easier for the pinboard code to use it.
Up and Home buttons on the toolbar now use the 'New window on button 1'
option setting (suggested by Vincent Lefèvre).

09-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinboard can have mount points and symlinks on it.

06-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging with the Menu button moves icons around. Clicking with the
other button removes icons from the pinboard.

05-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging files to the pinboard adds them to it and automatically saves
the pinboard too.

02-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinboard is now loaded from a file specified on the command line.

01-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
'Home' now appears on the background if you run it with --pinboard.
Clicking opens your home directory. Doesn't do much else.
Fixed a bug which prevented the minibuffer label from appearing on
some versions of GTK+.

30-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
First steps towards pinboard support (requested by P.S.S.Camp and
Darren Winsper).

16-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the Display menu layout - now there are four basic types (Large or
Small, with or without details) and the type of detail desired is chosen
from a sub-sub-menu.

Added a new display style - bars showing the sizes of the files. The bars are
drawn on a log scale.

15-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the display menu - you can now choose large or small icons, with or
without details. The details displayed can also be changed. I'm not quite
happy with the UI yet though...

Split the filer.c source file into two (filer.c and display.c) since it was
becoming rather unwieldy. This means that some of the option names have
changed because they've moved to a new section in the options window...

14-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a problem where ImLib support failed on multi-depth displays (reported
by Stephen Harrison).

06-Jun-2000 (Release 0.1.24)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added the install.sh script for easier installation.
Removed 'MIME-info' file from ROX-Filer - now we always assume that the
standard types are in Choices.
Fixed a bug which could cause 'top' panels to appear in the wrong place
(Alex Holden).
Changed the sort order for Sort By Type so that directories come before
files (suggested by Chris Garrett).
`Single-click navigation' and 'Ignore case when sorting' now both default
to On.

03-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved the theme support to allow tiled background images.
Fixed a bug which prevented tilde expansion from working in the
shell command minibuffer.

02-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made the help button look a bit nicer and changed the Find and Permissions
action windows to use the icon instead of a text button.
Removed the 3D borders from the help and toolbar buttons when not selected
(looks much better!). Setting a run action by dragging to a symlink now
dereferences the link (suggested by Ewan Mac Mahon).

Default search path for Choices is now:
	~/Choices:/usr/local/share/Choices:/usr/share/Choices

Fixed (possibly) a bug which sometimes causes the redraw to miss bits. This
probably slows everything down, but the next Gtk+ release should do double
buffering so all this will get changed then...

01-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a Help icon to the toolbar, which does the same as choosing `Show
ROX-Filer Help' from the menu.

25-May-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Started adding some code to truncate long filenames (not finished yet).
Fixed a bug which could cause directories to appear empty when using VFS.
Added the 'Select If' minibuffer, which selects all files matching the
entered expression.

21-May-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moved most of the icons from pixmaps to MIME-icons (outside ROX-Filer).
Updated several of the remaining icons by copying them from the GNOME
desktop (suggested by Volker Braun).


16-May-2000 (Release 0.1.23)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added the `Window->Set Run Action' menu item. This allows you to specify the
default run action for a file by simply dragging the file into a program.
You can also enter a shell command in the minibuffer to make that command
the default.
The cursor is a bit nicer and usually appears where you want it to now. You
can also get rid of it by pressing Escape.

12-May-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Applied Bernard's patch (a couple of cosmetic changes to the action windows).
Applied Vincent's patch (minor updates to the Frech translation).
Fixed a problem with the pixmap caching - the filer would detect that the
file had changed and try to reload it, but ImLib would simply return its
cached copy!

28-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed a debugging message that had somehow got into the release version :-(
Fixed a bug in the minibuffer code - pressing Return when the cursor was in
an empty directory caused odd effects.

24-Apr-2000 (Release 0.1.22)
~~~~~~~~~~~
When starting, the filer will check to see if it is already running.
If it is then the arguments are passed to that copy.

23-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bug fix: Attempting to open a Find preview window could cause a crash
if the directory containing the item could not be opened.
Button-3 clicking on the toolbar icons opens a new window.


21-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Vincent Lefevre's French translation. Changed to using my own
gettext function because some platforms don't have it or implement
it differently.

18-Apr-2000 (Release 0.1.21)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Completed marking translatable strings. Dragging with the middle button
now moves files.

17-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made lots of changes to the way menus are stored; this makes i18n of the
menus easier.

16-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added GNU gettext support.
Shell meta-characters in shell commands are escaped.

15-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tab in the shell commands minibuffer does shell-style completion.

14-Apr-2000 (Release 0.1.20)
~~~~~~~~~~~
ImLib is used for rendering if possible. Small Icons super-samples the
image down.

13-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Copying from inside a VFS directory now works.

09-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added the Shell Command feature to the minibuffer.
Fixed a bug which causes unnecessary flickering when a hidden file was
detected.
Removed 'Touch' from the menu; easy enough from the minibuffer now.
Changed the type guessing system - scans all files in MIME-info directories
now.

02-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a nice list displaying the found files. Clicking opens a preview window
onto the directory and winks the file.

18-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Merged the MIME-Type and Special fields in the info window into a single
Type field (since only one could be used at a time anyway).
Made lots of changes to the panel menu. You can now remove things much more
easily.
Unstat()able files now display the error message in the Full Info display,
instead of random values.
Check for copying a directory onto itself, as well as into itself.

Applied Bernard's patch:
- Copy (menu entry) now works with action window.
- Deleted/moved directory displays are automatically hidden.
- Added option not to allow run/copy when object
  dragged to filer (not panels) icons. Some people like
  it the RISC OS way...
- Full info alignment of App objects and owner/group
  alignment corrected.
- Info window: added special info for symlinks, apps
  and mount points.

17-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for mc's Virtual File System.

12-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
New Window appears greyed out if Unique Windows is selected.
Added 'Permissions' (chmod) feature.

10-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Bernard Jungen's patch:
- Dates are displayed in a more RISC OS like format.
- (Scanning) is shown in the titlebar during scans.
- Option to only display one window per directory.
- User and group names displayed in the Full Info view.
- Open Parent in the root does nothing.
- Errors in options are only reported once.
- File does chdir() if -b isn't possible (prevents getting the full path
  in the file(1) says... box).
